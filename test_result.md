# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  REAL-TIME ALERT WHISPERER SYSTEM:
  Transform into real-time MSP ops agent with:
  1. Remove ALL fake data generators (✅ DONE)
  2. Real-time monitoring with WebSocket live updates

  4. Alert correlation with 15-minute time window
  5. Real-time dashboard with live metrics (alerts by priority, incidents by status)
  6. Priority-based filtering (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  7. Auto-correlation and AI decision engine
  8. Chat system for company communication
  9. Notification system for critical alerts
  10. Browser notifications for high-priority alerts

      MAJOR UPDATE: Completely redesigned company onboarding and added technician management!
      
      ✅ Company Management Improvements:
         - When creating a company, immediately shows API key and integration instructions in a beautiful modal
         - Added "View Integration" button (key icon) on each company card to see API key anytime
         - Integration dialog shows:
           * API key with copy button
           * Webhook URL with copy button
           * Example cURL request with copy button
           * What happens next (alerts → correlation → technician assignment)
           * Security best practices
      
      ✅ NEW: Technicians Management Page (/technicians):
         - Complete CRUD operations for technicians
         - Add new technicians with name, email, password
         - Edit technician details (name, email, optionally update password)
         - Delete technicians (with confirmation)
         - Beautiful card-based UI showing all technicians
         - Role badges and creation dates
         - Info section explaining technician permissions
      
      ✅ Navigation Changes:
         - Removed "Integration Settings" from header (no longer needed as separate page)
         - Added "Technicians" button in header
         - Removed "Integrations" from user dropdown menu
         - Cleaner navigation focused on actual management tasks
      
      ✅ Backend API Additions:
         - GET /api/users - List all users (admin only)
         - POST /api/users - Create new user/technician (admin only)
         - PUT /api/users/{user_id} - Update user details (admin only)
         - DELETE /api/users/{user_id} - Delete user (admin only)
         - All endpoints include proper admin permission checks
      
      The system now has a complete flow:
      1. Admin adds company → sees API key immediately
      2. Admin adds technicians who will handle alerts
      3. Company sends alerts using their API key
      4. Alerts are correlated into incidents
      5. Admin assigns incidents to technicians
      6. Technicians resolve incidents
      
      All services running successfully!
