# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  PRODUCTION-GRADE AWS MSP ALERT WHISPERER SYSTEM:
  Enterprise-ready MSP platform with AWS best practices:
  
  ✅ COMPLETED (Previous Phase):
  1. Remove ALL fake data generators
  2. Real-time monitoring with WebSocket live updates
  3. Enhanced priority scoring: priority = severity + critical_asset_bonus + duplicate_factor + multi_tool_bonus - age_decay
  4. Alert correlation with 15-minute time window
  5. Real-time dashboard with live metrics (alerts by priority, incidents by status)
  6. Priority-based filtering (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  7. Auto-correlation and AI decision engine
  8. Chat system for company communication
  9. Notification system for critical alerts
  10. Browser notifications for high-priority alerts
  11. Only real data from company webhooks - NO FAKE DATA
  
  🚀 NEW (Production-Grade AWS MSP Features):
  1. HMAC-SHA256 webhook authentication with replay protection (X-Signature, X-Timestamp headers)
  2. Event-driven correlation with configurable time window (5-15 min)
  3. Aggregation key system (asset|signature) for intelligent grouping
  4. Per-company webhook security configuration (enable/disable HMAC)
  5. Per-company correlation settings (time window, auto-correlate)
  6. Multi-tenant isolation patterns (per-tenant API keys, data partitioning)
  7. AWS Secrets Manager integration documentation
  8. AWS Systems Manager (SSM) remote execution documentation
  9. Cross-account IAM role setup for MSP client access
  10. API Gateway WebSocket migration guide
  11. Patch Manager compliance integration documentation

      ✅ NEW: Technicians Management Page (/technicians):
         - Complete CRUD operations for technicians
         - Add new technicians with name, email, password
